## Instructions

You may work individually or up to a team of 3 for this assigment.

Please follow the instructions carefully. Note: failure to do so will result in a reduction of 10% of this homework grade. If you make a mistake, you can always delete the entire repo and try again (but of course, save your code).  
1. Go to [https://classroom.github.com/g/YVgwYgBa](https://classroom.github.com/g/YVgwYgBa).  
2. Create a team (individual or up to 3 people).  
3. Clone the repository to your unix environment and create a separate submission branch. If you're working in a pair, you may work on the same branch or on separate branches. But when submitting your homework, please consolidate your submission into 1 branch.
4. Push your submission branch to the repo.
5. Create a pull request against the master. **Do not merge to master as it will prevent anyone from giving you a review or comments**
